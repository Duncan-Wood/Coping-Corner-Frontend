## Description

Coping Corner is a full-stack application built with `Postresql/Express/React/Node` featuring user authentication and full CRUD operations. The application aims to create a community for individuals who struggle to cope with their mental state and provide resources to help them along their mental health journey.

### Features

- Users can create an account and log in securely with their credentials.
- Users can add resources to their "Toolkit" and like resources that they find helpful.
- Users can post their own resources to be viewed and accessed by other Coping Corner users.
- The resources feature has full CRUD operations.<br/>

Coping Corner aims to facilitate connections among individuals who may resonate with the advice of their peers more than outsiders and make a positive impact on those who struggle with their mental health.

## Future Updates

Coping Corner is our first PERN app, and it was created in just one week. As a result, there is a lot more we would like to add, such as:<br/>

- Allow users to access comments with full CRUD operations
- Allow users to edit the contents of their resources rather than only the likes
- Allow users to search through resources based on types and feelings in addition to title and content
- Add a journal component for users to track their mood and thoughts over time
- Allow users to create and add tags to resources for more discoverability
- Allow users to add friends and message them directly
