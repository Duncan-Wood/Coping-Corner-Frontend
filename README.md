## Description
Coping Corner is a full-stack `Postresql/Express/React/Node` application with user authentication and full CRUD operations. Users are able to create an account and log in securely with their credentials. This application is made to create a community for those who are struggling to cope with their mental state and find resources to help them along their mental health journey. Users can add resources to their 'Toolkit,' as well as add likes to resources that they find helpful. Also, users can post their own resources to be viewed and accessed by other users of Coping Corner. Resources has full CRUD operations. We are often more likely to resonate with advice from our peers than from outsiders, so Coping Corner is meant to facilitate these connections and make a real impact on those who struggle with their mental health.

- Users can edit the contents of their resources rather than only the likes
- Users will be able to search through resources based on Types and Feelings in addition to Title and Content
- Users will have a journal component to track their mood and thoughts over time
- Users can create and add tags to resources for more discoverability 
- Users can add friends and message them directly
