## Description

Coping Corner is a full-stack application built with `Postresql/Express/React/Node` featuring user authentication and full CRUD operations. The application aims to create a community for individuals who struggle to cope with their mental state and provide resources to help them along their mental health journey. Users can create an account and log in securely with their credentials. They can add resources to their "Toolkit" and like resources that they find helpful. Additionally, users can post their own resources to be viewed and accessed by other Coping Corner users. The resources feature has full CRUD operations. Coping Corner aims to facilitate connections among individuals who may resonate with the advice of their peers more than outsiders and make a positive impact on those who struggle with their mental health.

## Future Updates

Coping Corner is our first PERN app, and it was created in just one week. As a result, there is a lot more we would like to add, such as:<br/>

- Allow users to access comments with full CRUD operations
- Allow users to edit the contents of their resources rather than only the likes
- Allow users to search through resources based on types and feelings in addition to title and content
- Add a journal component for users to track their mood and thoughts over time
- Allow users to create and add tags to resources for more discoverability
- Allow users to add friends and message them directly
